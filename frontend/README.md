# Frontend (Vite + React + Tailwind) - Starter

## Run locally (free)

1. Ensure Node.js (16+) and npm/yarn are installed.
2. From `frontend/` run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the local dev URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes:
- Tailwind is configured. If you see default styling missing, ensure `npm install` ran successfully.
- The app includes a single dashboard mockup component (static UI) to iterate on.
